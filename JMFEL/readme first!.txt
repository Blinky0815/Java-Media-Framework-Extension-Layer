If you are new to JMF or mutlimedia programming in general, please take a look at java media framework.pdf.
The examples folder contains examples - easy and complicated as well - PLEASE start with the easy ones.

The documentation folder also contains the Beaker-Model folder, which cointains auto generated UML models of JMFEL classes and examples.
