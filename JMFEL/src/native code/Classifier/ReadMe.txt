    JNI Dynamic Link Library (DLL) : "Classifier" Project Overview
========================================================================

JNI DLL has created this "Classifier" project
for you as a starting point.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files
that make up your project.

Classifier.vcproj
    This is the main project file for projects generated using an Application
    Wizard. It contains information about the version of the product that
    generated the file, and information about the platforms, configurations,
    and project features selected with the Application Wizard.

Classifier.cpp
    This is the main DLL source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

The Application Wizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.

For the sake of portability, by default this application does not use
precompiled headers. However, you may enable precomplied header support
manually if you would like this feature.

This application supports JNI interoperability. Due to this, it requires
a VM or JRE for development and deployment.
