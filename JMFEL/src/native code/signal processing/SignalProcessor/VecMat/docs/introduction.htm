<H1>1. Introduction.</H1>

<P>This is a set of vector and matrix classes, as well as some supporting tools
and math functions, and a set of simple random number generation classes. This
software is designed for scientific programming, and as such, I have tried to
build in as much functionality as possible, without sacrificing any more
performance than necessary. This is accomplished in part by using a view-based
model, to prevent unnecessary copying of data.</P>

<H2>1.1. What it is not.</H2>

<P>This software is not intended as a linear algebra package. It only supports
very basic linear algebra operations like matrix multiplication, dot products,
and matrix-vector multiplication, and these routines are only as optimized as
much as is possible without knowing specific information about the platform
being used. This is also not intended as a numerical toolkit. On the contrary,
it is designed to be compatible with other software that serves those purposes,
such as the <EM>Numerical Recipes in C++</EM> software, and the <EM>FFTW</EM>
fast Fourier transform <EM>C</EM> libraries, and the <EM>CBLAS</EM> and
<EM>LAPACK</EM> libraries.</P>
