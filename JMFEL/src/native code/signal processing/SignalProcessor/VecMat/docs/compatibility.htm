<H1>17. Compatibility Issues.</H1>

<P>This software makes extensive use of the <EM>C++ Standard Library</EM>. It
is therefore necessary that your compiler properly support the <EM>Standard
Library</EM>, and in particular, the <EM>Standard Template Library</EM>
(<EM>STL</EM>). One possible source of compiler difficulties may be in the use
of streaming IO. The <EM>VecMat</EM> software uses the <EM>Standard
Library</EM> header files "iostream" and "fstream". The <EM>Standard
Library</EM> streaming IO headers cannot be used within the same project as the
nonstandard streaming IO headers, such as "iostream.h".</P>

<P>I have only tested the current version of the software on the following
platforms so far.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>gcc 3.2 & 3.4 (Windows 2000 & XP, using MinGW)</LI>
  <LI>gcc 3.2 & 3.4 (Linux)</LI></UL>
</UL>

<P>It seems to work ok on these platforms. It may or may not work on the latest
version of <EM>Microsoft VC++</EM>, but I do know that it does not work on
older versions, due to non-compliance with the <CODE>C++</CODE> standard.</P>

<P>I have not yet tested in on any 64bit platforms. It <EM>should</EM> work, as
I have been very careful to use <CODE>size_t</CODE> and <CODE>ptrdiff_t</CODE>
whenever working with integers which refer to memory sizes or differences.
However, some warnings may occur due to implicit casting from 64bit integer
types to 32bit integer types.</P>

<P>If you find any errors or compatibility problems, please let me know.
Likewise if you find that the code works on platforms other than those I have
tested it on. Please send any feedback to
