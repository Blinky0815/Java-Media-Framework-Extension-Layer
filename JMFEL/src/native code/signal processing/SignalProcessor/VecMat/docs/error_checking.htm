<H1>12. Error Checking.</H2>

<P>The <EM>VecMat</EM> software provides basic error checking for its classes
and functions. Rather than throwing exceptions, I have used the simpler and
more straightforward method of simply aborting with a run-time error when
something undefined happens. Most of the error checking incurs no significant
performance hit, and is enabled all of the time. Bounds-checking when indexing
vectors and matrices can be a very inefficient process, though, so this is by
default enabled only for debug builds. This is done by checking for the flag
<CODE>__DEBUG__</CODE>, which is set by gcc when a debug build is being
compiled. For other systems, other flags may be used, so you may need to adjust
this. You can also set it to always, or never do bounds checking for indexing.
See the header file "vm_basic.h" for more details.</P>

<P>No error checking is done for iterators, with the exception that the
<CODE>row_begin()</CODE>, <CODE>row_end()</CODE>, <CODE>col_begin()</CODE>,
and <CODE>col_end()</CODE> matrix member functions will generate an error if
you attempt to create an iterator to a row or column that does not exist.</P>

<P>There are three types of errors that the basic <EM>VecMat</EM> software can
produce.</P>

<H2>12.1. Memory allocation error.</H2>

<P>This occurs when the software attempts to allocate memory for a block of
data, and fails.</P>

<H2>12.2. Size mismatch error.</H2>

<P>This occurs when a function or operator requires that two objects have the
same size (or in the case of matrices, when a relationship between dimensions
must exist), and this requirement is not met. An error will also be returned if
functions are called for empty objects that don't make any sense for such
objects, such as <CODE>sum()</CODE>, <CODE>min()</CODE>, and
<CODE>max()</CODE>.</P>

<H2>12.3. Index out of bounds error.</H2>

<P>This occurs when you attempt to create a view of an object that would end up
viewing outside of the boundaries of the original object. If bounds-checking is
enabled, then it will also occur if you attempt to index a vector or matrix out
of bounds.</P>
